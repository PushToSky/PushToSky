# PushToSky

Phone-based Astronomical Telescope Control, Simply 

Push to Sky is a low-cost control system for astronomical telescopes that uses mobile phone sensors. 

Connect to the world of stars ‚Äì look up at the sky and control smartly! 

üåü Key Features

üì± 

Phone-based manual control The current direction of the telescope can be determined and tracked in real-time using the mobile phone's sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, compass). 

üéØ 

Compatible with azimuthal telescopes Specifically designed for alt-azimuth mechanical systems, making it easy to use with Dobsonians, refractors, or beginner non-motorized systems. 

üõ∞Ô∏è 

Sensor data processing with Kalman filter Filters and smooths noisy mobile sensor data, providing a more reliable position estimate of the telescope's direction. 

‚ú® 

Star calibration and correction Through one-star or multi-point teaching, the system can correct sensor errors ‚Äì ensuring even more precise targeting. 

üåê 

Client-server connection Phone data is sent to the PC via Wi-Fi, where the system displays the current direction, suggests movements, and allows orientation using a virtual sky. 

User Manual 

Installation Kit: 

Phone: 

    TelescopeMotionSender for Push_to_Sky.apk (Sends orientation data to the Push_to_Sky system) 

GPS Sender for Push_to_Sky.apk (Sends GPS data to the Push_to_Sky system) 

Laptop/Desktop: 

    Push_to_Sky_1.0-Linux 

config.ini file 

How to use: 

    Mount the phone on the telescope. 

Install TelescopeMotionSender for Push_to_Sky.apk and GPS Sender for Push_to_Sky.apk on your phone. 

Place the Push_to_Sky_1.0-Linux and config.ini files in the same folder on your laptop. 

Start the Push_to_Sky_1.0-Linux application, then GPS Sender for Push_to_Sky.apk from your phone. This will provide your exact location to the Push_to_Sky_1.0-Linux application (Remember to provide your laptop's exact IP address). 

Restart the Push_to_Sky_1.0-Linux application. 

Now, start the TelescopeMotionSender for Push_to_Sky.apk (Sends orientation data to the Push_to_Sky system) application on your phone (Remember to provide your laptop's exact IP address). 

Point the telescope, for example, at Antares and mark it in the one-star teaching. 

Now, in the Tracking tab, you can select an object you like (Deep sky objects/M3), where the system will navigate using the control system. 

Phone sensors are not very accurate, so manual correction may be needed occasionally.
